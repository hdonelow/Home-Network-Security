# Home Network Security Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing a robust network security and access control system for a home environment. The guide provides detailed instructions and resources to enhance data integrity, protect sensitive information, and improve user privacy.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary hardware and software components set up in your homelab environment. Refer to the [Prerequisites](./docs/Prerequisites.md) document for detailed requirements and setup instructions.

## Architecture

Explore the [Architecture](./docs/Architecture.md) document for an in-depth explanation of the network architecture, including diagrams and configuration files for routers, switches, and firewall appliances.

## Encryption

Learn how to enable WPA3 encryption on Wi-Fi and implement SSL/TLS for critical services by following the steps outlined in the [Encryption](./docs/Encryption.md) guide.

## Access Control Policies

Create user accounts on devices and servers, and implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the guidelines provided in [Access Control Policies](./docs/AccessControl.md).

## Authentication Mechanisms

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical services and set up SSH key-based authentication using the instructions in [Authentication Mechanisms](./docs/Authentication.md).

## Security Software

Install antivirus software on servers and workstations with the provided installation scripts and configure regular scans and updates as outlined in [Security Software](./docs/SecuritySoftware.md).

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging on firewalls, servers, and other devices, and set up a centralized logging solution with the help of the [Monitoring and Logging](./docs/MonitoringLogging.md) guide.

## Incident Response Plan

Develop an incident response plan with step-by-step actions, and test it using simulation scripts or scenarios provided in [Incident Response Plan](./docs/IncidentResponse.md).

## Security Awareness Training

Educate family members or users about security best practices with the resources available in [Security Awareness Training](./docs/SecurityAwareness.md).

## Regular Audits and Assessments

Use scripts and tools for periodic log review and vulnerability scanning. Learn how to interpret scan results in [Regular Audits and Assessments](./docs/AuditsAssessments.md).

## Vendor Security

Follow guidelines for keeping firmware and software up-to-date and best practices for securing IoT devices in [Vendor Security](./docs/VendorSecurity.md).

## Compliance

Ensure compliance with relevant regulations, and use templates for GDPR compliance related to personal data, as outlined in [Compliance](./docs/Compliance.md).

## Documentation

Maintain detailed documentation on network architecture, access control policies, and incident response. Use templates for updating documentation when changes are made, as described in [Documentation](./docs/Documentation.md).

## Continuous Improvement

Stay informed about the latest security threats and learn how to reassess security measures and make improvements by referring to [Continuous Improvement](./docs/ContinuousImprovement.md).

## Additional Considerations

Explore additional considerations such as setting up a VPN, regular data backups, and network segmentation in the [Additional Considerations](./docs/AdditionalConsiderations.md) document.

## Contributing

Please refer to the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide if you wish to contribute to the project.

## License

This project is open-source. Review the [License](./LICENSE) for details.

## Conclusion

Thank you for exploring the Home Network Security Project. We encourage you to actively maintain and improve the security of your home network.
